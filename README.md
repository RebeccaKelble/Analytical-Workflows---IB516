Work for course IB 516 (Analytical Workflows)

Testing out the process of creating a new branch. Created a new branch "testing_branch".

Going to experiment with reverting back changes (I make a commit I regret).

Adding another line.

Now trying to create a conflict.

Trying to work through these conflicts now...
